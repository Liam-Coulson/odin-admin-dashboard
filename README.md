I decided to complete the project by imitating the styling of the example finished web page. Many of the buttons and what you would expect to be hyperlinks (like the trending profiles) are not buttons or hyperlinks. The image credit button does work however, and when clicks, displays credit for the images and icons used.

The animal profile images were made by Freepik from Flaticon, and the SVG icons used throughout are taken from various users on Pictogrammers with some being licensed under the Apache license which is included in its own file.
